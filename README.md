## Step 1
Here first the Deep learning model for ChatBot is created by using nltk and tensorflow libraries
For that first define some intents and saved as ".json" format. Here I defined few simple intents and bunch of messages that corresponds to those intents and also map some responses according to each intent category and saved as a file named “intents.json”. And then run the "Chatbot_Model.ipynb" and get trained model.

## step 2
By using the trained model build the web application by Flask web framework. For that clone the entire folder in the same order and run it.
